This is the whole code of my personal Website, you can look it at www.tommasosirigu.it.

For coding the site i used HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript. I used JavaScript ES6, also known as ECMASCRIPT2015. ES6 added some new features such as arrow functions, "let" command and more. Documentation about ES6 at https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_es6.asp
